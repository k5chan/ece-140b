    <h2>Costs Section</h2>
        <p> 
            We estimate the product costs should be around $25. The cost of our prototype was 28 dollars: 6 mpu6050 sensors($2) 1 ultrasonic sensor($4) 1 multiplexier($9) and an arduino d1 mini($3). 
            This however is the price of our prototype without volumes of scale, labor cost, or shipping costs factored in. We expect the actual cost of our product to drop significantly to around
            25 dollars because we were buying individual components driving the price way up.

            To maintain our website we will expect it to cost between $400 and $1000 each year.
            The cost for app store development with server fees would add $240 to 720 dollars per year.In total it would cost around $525-$1825 to just run the software that is included in our product.
            This does not include the cost of labor to maintain our app and fixing bugs.

    <h2>Revenue Section</h2>
        <p>
            We plan to have a one time fee for our hardware product and then a free app with a purchasable subscription to access more premium features. The user ca either use the 
            free,monthly, or yearly subscription version of the app. The yearly subscription will be around $50. The monthly subscription will be around $9. In total we expect to have 50,000 app users
            with around 5000 subscriptions in total every month. The cost of our product will be $25 dollars and we will the the product with a markup of 14% and sell the hardware for $28.50. The reason why
            our sales margin is not that high is because we want our hardware to be our loss leader, drawing in more users to hopefully purchase our in-app subscription.
