    <h2>Design principles</h2>
        <h2>
            What basic information does a typical user need to have access to on first interaction with your product?
        </h2>
        <p> 
            The user needs to know that the sensors need to be placed at joints along the body. The user also needs
            to know how to connect the app to the device in addition to knowing how to navigate the app.
               
        </p> 
        <h2>
            What IA Design Principles (Dan Brown) are important for your product?
        </h2>
        <p> 
            I think all of the IA Design Principles are important for my product but I think that the principle 
            of growth and disclosure are the most important for my product. The principle of disclosure is really 
            important because our product will have multiple layers of complexity and it would be best if we 
            progressively disclose information rather than have an information dump on the user. The principle of 
            growth is also important because our product is in its beta form so it would be best if we gave our 
            product IA room to grow and develop. 
        </p>    
        <h2>
            Which structural Organizational Principle(s) make(s) the most the sense for your product?
        </h2> 
        <p> 
            I think that the Sequential and the Chronological IA Organizational Principle make the most sense for
            my product. The Sequential Organizational Principle makes sense because our product will have to 
            include alot of user input so we will need to implement a navigational process. The Chronological 
            Organizational Principle makes sense for some of our product because we want the user to look at past
            stats of his/her self and compare. This is because our product in a way is a performance tracker.
