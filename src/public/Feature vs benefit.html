    <h2> Features and their benefits</h2>
      <table class="table1">
        <tr>
          <td class="empath">Low cost:
            <br>The low cost makes our product less committal relative to other options.
            <br>This benefits the essentially everyone but mainly the more common athlete. 
            <br>This is because one can spend less and still get a great product without 
            <br>making a dent in their pockets.
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td class="empath">Wireless connection(wifi)
            <br>This feature heavily benefits customer experience because wires are 
            <br>notoriously horrible to work with so minimizing the amount exposed to the
            <br>user would greatly improve the customer experience. The wifi of our product
            <br>makes it feel like the user isn't even wearing anything.
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td class="empath">Uses Arduino D1 Mini
            <br>This feature overall greatly improves the customer experience because of
            <br>the Arduino D1 Mini's lightweight frame and it's corresponding sensors.
            <br>This benefits the more serious Athletes because practice with our product 
            <br>and without would feel nearly identical.
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td class="empath">Has interactive app
            <br>This features makes the user experience overall better. This is because 
            <br>user can use the app like a social media platform for sports. Users can see
            <br>their friends profiles and feel interconnected in a thing that is bigger than
            <br>themselfs. This makes the app more than just an information gather but makes it
            <br>a social app.
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td class="empath">Multi-sport/Multi functional
            <br>Because of the nature of our product we can not only use our product for 
            <br>basketball but for other sports as well. This is beneficial to the common
            <br>athlete because the versility of our product makes our product less committal
            <br>as we have a general product instead of a one sport product.
