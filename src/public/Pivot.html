    <title> Pivots </title>

    <h2>Our journey</h2>
        <p> 
            A pivot we have already undertaken is we've changed hardware. Initially we wanted to use 
            radio frequencies to transmit our data instead of bluetooth but we insteaded to opt for none of
            those options and just use wifi adapters so we can upload data straight to our databases. Another 
            pivot we went through was determining our customer personas. We initially wanted to target amatuer 
            athletes but we decided that a more accurate persona would be just a sports enthusiast. If we were
            to move on with this startup after ece 140b we would have to do a huge technology pivot because
            currently we're just not accurate enough with our sensors to collect reliable information.

    <h2>Types of pivots we've taken</h2>
        <p>
            zoom-out pivot<br>
            We think that we preformed a zoom-out pivot because initially we decided to only have a 
            product with a corresponding app but when we decided to add interconnectiveness in our app
            and make our app more like a social platform rather than just a data center for our product
            <br>customer segment pivot<br>
            Initially we thought our customers were amatuer athletes but we later realised more and more
            sports enthusaists would rather have our product 
            <br>platform pivot<br>
            We initally started our app as an information feedback system for our product but it's turned
            into a psuedo social media platform.
            <br>technology pivot<br>
            We have had a technology pivot because we found out that radio frequencies were just too 
            hard to work with so we switched to wifi arduino modules and subsequently went from 3
            information transfers to just one.
