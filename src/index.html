    <h2> Our product: </h2>
      <p> 
          Currently our product targets amateur and semi professional athletes. By using different types of sensor in wristbands worn at various parts of the body our product will be able to track the movement of different body parts. This input data would be then compared to a standarized movement path. The result would be a score given based on different aspects of their form.
