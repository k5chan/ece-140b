        <h2>Product Interactions</h2>
            <p>Our MVP design is all about visual interpretation of data and easy app navigation.
                <br>The visual interpretation part of our product will be essentially a 3d model of
                <br>a skeleton going through the same range of motions of the user. This helps the Users
                <br>achieve their goal of getting better because they can overlay each attempt and see 
                <br>the minute differences. This clearly would show how consistent/inconsistent a user is 
                <br>in addition to showing good or bad patterns that the user is developing. App navigation
                <br>is also a huge part of our MVP design. With easy fillout tables to customize each device
                <br>to a specific user we can get through the hassle of asking for information about users
                <br>Also with the app we are leaning towards more of a social platform instead of a pure
                <br>goal based app making it something more reuseable. With the ability to see stats of
                <br>friends and family people can have friendly competitions making the product less
                <br>about self-improvement but also for it's social aspects.
